## Should I Continue to Pursue Tech? The Dilemma Every Student Is Facing Right Now

I'm a high school sophomore grappling with a question that's on the minds of many students: should I continue to pursue technology as a career? A bit of background—I'm deeply entrenched in full-stack development, mainly using TypeScript and go, but I also enjoy dabbling in Rust, Python, Java(no so much enjoy it as forced to learn it for school). I've fast-tracked through 3-4 years' worth of college-level computer science courses at my school in just one year and I'm currently working on an app for my school that they are interested in buying. On top of that, I've secured high placements in various programming competitions. I'm 15, and I share this not to boast, but to underscore my commitment to programming—a commitment I'm considering dedicating my life to.

Now, as sophomore year continues, conversations about college and career paths have been brought up again. My dad, a veteran in the tech field, is nudging me towards medicine. And he's not entirely off-base—I've had a long-standing interest in medical topics and spent significant time researching them in the past. However, something shifted for me during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eager to break my video game addiction, I pivoted from playing games to creating them. This led me down a three-year rabbit hole which leaves me here today. From that the beginning of the pandemic I’ve spent around 2 hours every day writing code(jumps up to every minute I can during holidays and weekends, and goes lower during periods of heavy school work).

I love programming, I'm good at it(relatively), and I want to pursue it full time. Yet, my dad raises a concern that's hard to dismiss: by the time I graduate from college( around 2030) , advances in AI could potentially render my chosen profession obsolete.

So here I am, caught in a quandary that's undoubtedly shared by many of my peers. Do I follow a well-trodden path in medicine, or do I gamble on a future in tech, a future that's as exciting as  it is uncertain? I feel if this was a few decades ago I would without a doubt choose tech.
